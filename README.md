# Excel-and-Tableau-Project
# Wealth of Nations Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository showcases my data analyst skills in data cleaning, data transformation, critical thinking, and data visualization. I utilized the "Wealth of Nations" dataset to perform these tasks and created interactive dashboards using Tableau.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning**: I meticulously cleaned the raw dataset to ensure data accuracy and consistency. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing data quality issues.

- **Data Transformation**: I employed Excel to transform the dataset, including aggregating data, creating calculated fields, and restructuring it for analysis. This step was crucial for deriving meaningful insights.

- **Critical Thinking**: I applied critical thinking to identify patterns, correlations, and trends within the data. This involved formulating hypotheses and conducting statistical analysis to test them.

- **Data Visualization**: Using Tableau, I created interactive and visually compelling dashboards to communicate the results of my analysis. These dashboards provide a user-friendly interface to explore the dataset and understand key insights.
